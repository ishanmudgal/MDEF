# Narratives_01 Proposal

??? abstract "Proposal"

    I would like my pictorial publication to be a chaotic coming together of my experiences and thoughts through the MDEF programme. I have always enjoyed making and working with physical zines and want this to resemble a zine rather than a formal publication. Having gotten tired of typical modes of presentation, I want to NOT clearly present a project, but rather present my journey. This zine should become a representation of the inside of my mind. I want to bring together my thoughts on culture and society, outer space and science, music and art, politics and activism, technology and the future, and performance and daily life. In terms of the format I want to play with collage art and mix media styles. I want to include my skethes, collage in pictures from the net and from magazines, sketch and write on top of all of those, and then stitch, paint, stick found materials, and god knows what else.
