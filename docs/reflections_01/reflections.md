# **To Question**

Where do I come from? What made me who I am? What am I? What am I going to be? What do I want to be?

This course left me with more questions than answers. So I'm leaving them all here.

What does it mean to be human? Were we ever truly human? Is it human nature to deny our mortality and find purpose beyond the workings of the world around us?

Will we survive our own misdeeds? Do we deserve the comfort we have built? What truly was the cost? Can it be calculated? Does a calculation show the real impact we have had on the environment? Does it reveal the damage we have done to ourselves?

What does it mean to beat death? Can we evolve? Can we induce metamorphosis? Can we endure metamorphosis? What would we morph into if we could? Would we transform to be better versions of ourselves? What does it mean to be better - to be stronger, more durable, or more responsible? Who decides? Is it individual? Do we respect the individual idea of being better no matter what?

# **To Dream**

I always dreamed of playing music on the stage. To perform. I always dreamed of fantastical worlds beyond the one we live in.

Some part of me always wanted to be an artist. In doing this does one become art?
