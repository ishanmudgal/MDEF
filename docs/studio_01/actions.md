The art of protest and dissent has its own history, deeply rooted every culture, in every part of the world. From slavery to war, from apartheid to crime, hardships brought on by systems of power and control have always resulted in counter-movements, protests riots and more.

## The Initial Journey

For this project, I explored creative applications and methodologies of dissent across the world. At first I was not clear on the path it would lead to. What caught my attention were the most experimental, the most absurd, the most creative movements. I realised that some of the most effective protests in the world had incredibly creative approaches. They were rooted in art, music and dance, and they had alternative forms of communication and messaging, often in secrecy. I found this incredibly intriguing and decided to study the art of protest itself. With this I was able to finally decide my research interest: The methodology of creative forms of dissent.
