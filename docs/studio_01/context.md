The art of protest and dissent has its own history, deeply rooted every culture, in every part of the world. From slavery to war, from apartheid to crime, hardships brought on by systems of power and control have always resulted in counter-movements, protests riots and more.

For this project, I explored creative applications and methodologies of dissent across the world. At first I was not clear on the path it would lead to. What caught my attention were the most experimental, the most absurd, the most creative movements. I realised that some of the most effective protests in the world had incredibly creative approaches. They were rooted in art, music and dance, and they had alternative forms of communication and messaging, often in secrecy. I found this incredibly intriguing and decided to study the art of protest itself. With this I was able to finally decide my research interest: The methodology of creative forms of dissent.

To begin, I started exploring three main areas:

- **Information**

  A database that has a variety of information for people working with protests, or in areas of riots and other such scenarios where they wish to practice dissent for any kind of impact.

- **Communication**

  Secret coded communication tools for those taking part in protests, or in situations where communications are blocked or forces of control are being avoided.

- **Preparation**

  To prepare for protests or other adverse situations, a guide to prepare a kit for any scenario with things that may be found at home.
