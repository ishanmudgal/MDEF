## MASTER IN DESIGN FOR EMERGENT FUTURES

Welcome to the void where design meets mortality.

### THE EXPERIMENT

This is not just documentation. This is an exploration of the liminal spaces between life and non-life, the organic and the synthetic, through the lens of brutalist aesthetics and emergent systems.

#### BRUTALIST AESTHETICS
Raw, unpolished forms and stark contrasts evoke existential dread and beauty.

#### EMERGENT SYSTEMS  
Self-organizing patterns and complex behaviors that arise from simple rules, mirroring life and death cycles.

#### POST-HUMAN DESIGN
Designing for a future where boundaries between human, machine, and environment blur.
