    The Masters for Design in Emergent Futures is a programme centered around the FabLab Barcelona, and is a collaboration between IAAC and Elisava. Bringing together technology and design, we explore radical ways of re-imagining the present world, exploring the tug of war between technology and biodiversity, and re-inventing alternative futures of a better world, while protyping these today.

My name is Ishan Mudgal, and you can see my work done during the **Masters in Design for Emergent Futures** programme at IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture) and Elisava, Barcelona. I am a designer, musician and artist who works at the boundary between fields. I am a jack of many trades (and master of some), and am currently working on bringing together my varied interests and projects. When not working (or grabbing post-work beers with friends), you can find me exploring Barcelona, making music, sketching or doing origami or some other craft.
