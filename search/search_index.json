I worked with Antonio &amp; Erandi on this project. You can see the work for each step below:</p> Day 01 - Laser Cutting <p>     We were inspired by tattoo art and tattoo style vinyl stickers and graffiti. We decided to use these kind of motifs on the outside of the box, for aesthetic purposes, and created a pattern inside to give the silicon mould some relief. A simple square marking on the base represents the position to place the 3d print for making the silicon mould later on. The laser cutting was fascinating to watch, and it was fun dismantling the pieces and then assembling them into the final box.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 02 - 3d Printing <p>     For the 3d printing we decided to create something that would have motion and be slightly interactive. We decided to make a maze (Erandi\u2019s genius idea) that people could play with. We made a second version in the form of a pyramid (Toni\u2019s genius idea), that was very difficult due to the slopes on the pyramid.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 03 - CNC <p>     We had to CNC to set up a base on which to place our final casting tiles for presenting. We made a simple maze-like pattern for an aesthetic finish that would support our final piece when ready.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 04 - Silicon Mould making <p>     We created a mould using the laser-cut box and the 3d printed maze, puring silicon into the space between. This process was challenging as preparing the silicon itsel required endless mixing and stirring, and had a tendency to get messy. The other challenge was that the box leaked a bit of silicon owing to small gaps between the assembled pieces.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 05 - Biomaterial Casting <p>     We created a pine resin formula for casting in our silicon mould. The process had many steps and ingredients, which can be found in the \u2018Recipe\u2019 section below.

We would be talking about pizza, and we had to say \u2018bro\u2019 before and after every sentence, making things very interesting, and difficult! Swarna received the secret message, and the game began! The rules set by the authority made it very difficult to play as everyone had to focus on them. This was perfect, and the authority was doing their thing. The dissenter tried passing out the message in a few different ways, and only a few words from the message were picked up.</p> <p>It was immediately evident that the game was too complicated, so we decided to simplify it to have only two codes, the indicator and the shifter. We played a few more rounds, and had interesting authority rules, like holding the nose while speaking, and good attempts by the players.</p> <p>After this session I decided to reduce the confusion and keep only the two codes from the beginning of the game for an offline playtest session. I also removed the authority\u2019s rule setting and kept it to deciding the topic of the conversation. The playtest was in the evening when everyone got done with their work and everyone was tired, which added to the overall confusion.</p> <p>Alejandra decided to be the Authority for both rounds, and did not set any fixed topic or rule, showing herself to be a very benevolent authority. The dissenters did a good job, with commoners figuring out a few words, and almost reaching the answer in one of the rounds.</p> <p>Despite very good attempts by the commoners, the authority won yet again. Throughout both the online and offline playtests, no one was able to use the shifter to communicate, except blue pasta. Although it was fun, the game was too complicated, and difficult to understand. It was also such that the players were hardly able to communicate without giving away the identity of the source.</p> <p>It turned out that it was still too difficult, and that my idea for the evolving encoding may not be the best one.</p> <p>Later at night, we went have a few beers after the playtest, and played a game where the group decides a rule, and one person does not know and has to figure out what rule it is. It could be tapping your beer twice after drinking, or everyone drinks when anybody touches their hair, etc. It was suggested by someone else, and was great to see because it worked much more smoothly than my game. Some rules were figured out, but some were impossible to figure, like the hair one. The person guessing figured out that we were drinking, but couldn\u2019t find the pattern.</p> <p>For my next test, I would like to simply give the condition of deciding a message and communicating it, without any rules as such and see what happens, possibly I will learn new tricks that could help build an evolving secret language.</p> <p>With the somewhat failure of Shifting Tongues, it seems the authority has won on this day, but there were many learnings, and with this the language will evolve and transform, and one day we may use it to fight oppressive powers without them even knowing.</p>"},{"location":"studio_01/action_prototypes/","title":"Prototyping the Actions","text":"<p>In order to understand my context better and filter it into concrete ideas to work with, I started with an initial research. I looked into a variety of creative protests and movements around the world to try and observe alternate methodologies that had been put into practice before. During this process I found it fascinating too see alternative methods of organisation, communication and action between the protesters themselves. Sometimes the protests were beautifully disguised, like in the case of the origin of Capoeira, and sometimes absurd yet effective, like the Chipko Movement. As I went through a variety of these, I realised there was an abundance of such examples with a lot of details for each. I immediately thought of putting these together in a google sheet to make my life easier, and also because it might be useful to someone else in the future. I then realised that an accessible and thorough database could be a powerful tool for people around the world.

The first output was mostly workable, although there were too many columns with information I didn\u2019t need.

I eventually kept this project aside for another time, especially as my interest in working with methods of communications and encoding them increased.</p> The Database <p></p> <p>As I worked with this data, I realised that many people who were in the situations where they needed to raise their voices and fight against a system of control, they rarely had access to such information or resources. With this I started conceptualising how this could be available secretly or even hidden in plain sight. Could I hide it behind a videogame?

Each button has a fixed colour and associated meaning that may be decided upon by the users beforehand, but the text and icons would keep changing.

Its operation is based on receiving radio frequency (RF) signals, converting them into audio signals, and playing the sound through its internal speaker.</p> <p>1) Radio Signal Reception The internal AM/FM antenna captures electromagnetic radio waves from broadcasting stations. The tuner selects a specific frequency in either the AM or FM band. A tuning circuit filters out all other frequencies, allowing only the chosen station to pass through.</p> <p>2) Signal Conversion Once the radio wave is received: The tuner sends the RF signal into the demodulator. The demodulator separates the audio information from the RF carrier wave. The extracted audio becomes a low-level signal \u2014 too weak to hear yet. This is the basic principle of AM/FM demodulation.</p> <p>3) Audio Amplification A built-in audio amplifier increases the strength of the audio signal. The amplified signal drives the internal 4W RMS loudspeaker.
