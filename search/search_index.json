I worked with Antonio &amp; Erandi on this project. You can see the work for each step below:</p> Day 01 - Laser Cutting <p>     We were inspired by tattoo art and tattoo style vinyl stickers and graffiti. We decided to use these kind of motifs on the outside of the box, for aesthetic purposes, and created a pattern inside to give the silicon mould some relief. A simple square marking on the base represents the position to place the 3d print for making the silicon mould later on. The laser cutting was fascinating to watch, and it was fun dismantling the pieces and then assembling them into the final box.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 02 - 3d Printing <p>     For the 3d printing we decided to create something that would have motion and be slightly interactive. We decided to make a maze (Erandi\u2019s genius idea) that people could play with. We made a second version in the form of a pyramid (Toni\u2019s genius idea), that was very difficult due to the slopes on the pyramid.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 03 - CNC <p>     We had to CNC to set up a base on which to place our final casting tiles for presenting. We made a simple maze-like pattern for an aesthetic finish that would support our final piece when ready.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 04 - Silicon Mould making <p>     We created a mould using the laser-cut box and the 3d printed maze, puring silicon into the space between. This process was challenging as preparing the silicon itsel required endless mixing and stirring, and had a tendency to get messy. The other challenge was that the box leaked a bit of silicon owing to small gaps between the assembled pieces.</p> Images <p>WIP</p> Day 05 - Biomaterial Casting <p>     We created a pine resin formula for casting in our silicon mould. The process had many steps and ingredients, which can be found in the \u2018Recipe\u2019 section below.

The slow and soft whistling of the wind, the untouched forests high up in the mountains, the snow-capped peaks hiding between the clouds. We went through a cloud, and as we came out, the entire valley was suddenly revealed. It felt like I could see the entire country, far far away.

The dissenter tried passing out the message in a few different ways, and only a few words from the message were picked up.</p> <p>It was immediately evident that the game was too complicated, so we decided to simplify it to have only two codes, the indicator and the shifter. We played a few more rounds, and had interesting authority rules, like holding the nose while speaking, and good attempts by the players.</p> <p>After this session I decided to reduce the confusion and keep only the two codes from the beginning of the game for an offline playtest session.

Throughout both the online and offline playtests, no one was able to use the shifter to communicate, except blue pasta. Although it was fun, the game was too complicated, and difficult to understand.

It could be tapping your beer twice after drinking, or everyone drinks when anybody touches their hair, etc. It was suggested by someone else, and was great to see because it worked much more smoothly than my game.

They were rooted in art, music and dance, and they had alternative forms of communication and messaging, often in secrecy. I found this incredibly intriguing and decided to study the art of protest itself. With this I was able to finally decide my research interest: The methodology of creative forms of dissent.</p> <p>To begin, I started exploring three main areas:</p> <ul> <li>Information</li> </ul> <p>A database that has a variety of information for people working with protests, or in areas of riots and other such scenarios where they wish to practice dissent for any kind of impact.</p> <ul> <li>Communication</li> </ul> <p>Secret coded communication tools for those taking part in protests, or in situations where communications are blocked or forces of control are being avoided.</p> <ul> <li>Preparation</li> </ul> <p>To prepare for protests or other adverse situations, a guide to prepare a kit for any scenario with things that may be found at home.</p>"},{"location":"unpacking_tech/forensic_reports/","title":"Forensic Reports &amp; Inventory","text":"<p>The links for the forensic reports are given below.

Its operation is based on receiving radio frequency (RF) signals, converting them into audio signals, and playing the sound through its internal speaker.</p> <p>1) Radio Signal Reception The internal AM/FM antenna captures electromagnetic radio waves from broadcasting stations. The tuner selects a specific frequency in either the AM or FM band. A tuning circuit filters out all other frequencies, allowing only the chosen station to pass through.</p> <p>2) Signal Conversion Once the radio wave is received: The tuner sends the RF signal into the demodulator. The demodulator separates the audio information from the RF carrier wave. The extracted audio becomes a low-level signal \u2014 too weak to hear yet. This is the basic principle of AM/FM demodulation.</p> <p>3) Audio Amplification A built-in audio amplifier increases the strength of the audio signal. The amplified signal drives the internal 4W RMS loudspeaker. This turns the electrical audio signal into audible sound (vibrations in air).</p> <p>4) Display and Controls A microcontroller inside the device reads user input from buttons:</p> <ul> <li>Power</li> <li>Band selection (AM/FM)</li> <li>Tuning up/down</li> <li>Volume control</li> <li>Station presets</li> </ul> <p>It shows tuning frequency and settings on the LCD screen. So although the radio technology is analog, the user interface is digital.</p> <p>5) AUX Mode When an external device (like a phone) is connected the AUX input bypasses the radio tuner. The external audio directly enters the amplifier, using the radio as a speaker system. No radio signal involved, just audio playback through its internal speaker.</p> <p>6) Power System The device mainly runs from AC mains power. It may also include a backup power function to retain saved stations if unplugged.</p> <p>Radio Waves \u2192 Antenna \u2192 Tuner \u2192 Demodulator \u2192 Audio Amplifier \u2192 Speaker \u2192 Sound \u2193 Microcontroller \u2192 LCD + Controls</p> <p>In AUX mode:</p> <p>External Device \u2192 AUX Jack \u2192 Audio Amplifier \u2192 Speaker \u2192 Sound</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"unpacking_tech/forensic_reports/#how-is-it-built","title":"How is it built?","text":"<p>It is constructed as a simple consumer-grade audio device: low-power electronics, mass-produced chassis, and standard loudspeaker design.</p> <p>The base for the build is a wood casing open on the front and back.
